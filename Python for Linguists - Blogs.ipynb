No licenses to sign, no royalties to pay, and _essentially no restrictions_ on what you can and can't do with it.  (the [Python Software Foundation license](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html) is an extremely permissive BSD-type license)\n",

    "    * \"There should be one, and preferably only one, obvious way to do it.\"  I.e., the most straightforward approach is _usually_ the best.  (This results in a lot of people writing straightforward, fairly easy-to-follow code).\n",

    "* General purpose language: can do (almost) everything you want to make it to.\n",
    "  * Compare to R, which is great for statistics, and a pain for a lot of other stuff.\n",

    "    * (this has been your mandatory \"Matlab is bad\" comment)\n",

    "  * [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), full of topic models and pretty bleeding-edge NLP tools.\n",
    "  * [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](http://www.nltk.org/), a _massive_ library that's designed to teach a lot of NLP concepts (but can be used for some serious production work too).\n",
    "  * [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for R-like dataframes, statistics, and general tabular data management.\n",

    "  * [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) for non-neural machine learning (support vector machines, random forests, and a few text features like basic preprocessing)\n",
    "    * Side note, the scikit-learn [User Guides](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) are an _excellent_ technical crash course in machine learning, even if you're not too interested in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ngrams are fun and all, but what if you want to find multi-word phrases that appear more often than they should by random chance alone (i.e., collocates)?  Well, as before, we could hack a bit of code together, or we could use a pre-built tool from the amazing Gensin library: the [Phrasing tools!](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/phrases.html)  These tools let you scan a(n already processed) corpus of texts, and finds bigrams that are collocated more than the raw prior distributions would indicate.  Then, these tools let you transform your original corpus, replacing these bigrams with a single token.  You can repeat this process all you want to find arbitrarily long phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing this, we should run our text through a basic preprocessing pipeline in Gensim.  We'll revisit this in a bit more detail later to talk about what it does; for now, just know that it automates a lot of the basic preprocessing steps for us, like lowercasing, removing stopwords, stemming, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use all the default values for our phrasing models except for the threshold (to guarnatee we find at least _some_ phrases for this demo), but they'll be provided explicitly to show how much customization there is.  Note that the phraser expectes a _list of sentences_, i.e. a _list of lists of words._  We don't strictly need to make them the actual sentences; the only reason Gensim says to use sentences is to avoid collocation across sentence boundaries."

Plus I'm doing homework, PLUS I'm watching Law & Order...how massively talented am I? Well, my day was pretty kick butt. Umm, no band OR music theory...very cool, so Kristen and I sat together and did homework and discussed Winter. Next period I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (Alex too for a bit, since he was in Gym) and I left eventually. They started working on music, and...I just always end up feeling left out when they do, so, I try to stay away from those two together in general.Oh well, I went and sat alone in a practice room. Darn...no good stories for the newspaper to write about me. That was a great story, no matter how angry people are about the band comment. I wish people would have read the story actually, instead of reaching paragraph two and deciding it was terrible. Well, anyway, umm...EPVM was interesting. I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother said it was difficult...my brother with the perfect ACT AND SAT scores...arg. I just...wow, I'm so afraid of that test. I'm completely going to fail. Gym...oh jeez...two words  Commando Crawl  OWWWWWWWWWWWWWW  Good lord...that was one of the most painful...oh jeez...just thinking about it. Seriously, if you ever by some chance do that for high ropes...WEAR PANTS! Well, yes...wear pants normally, but don't wear shorts, make sure they are pants, because...it's quite painful if you don't. I made it through though, so it's all good! It just hurt...a lot.   Math, boring, shock shock.  Intervening thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex??  Lunch...was interesting. Just hung out with Kelly and Emily some, then Chris and Alex. It was cool...not much to it. Comparative Religion was boring...just, meh, presenting projects...and finally chem...boring, shock shock, and then, I came home, and did stuff, and that is the end of my day...therefore, I shall leave, and go kill alex...I mean...wait...you know NOTHING.

    "\n",
    "NLP is fundamentally a branch of machine learning (ML) that focuses just on language data.  As such, it inherits a lot of ideas and concerns from ML.  One of the biggest ones is _sparsity_.  Sparsity is the phenomenon of having a lot of features with \"null\" values for a lot of your observations (this usually manifests as \"missing data\" or \"zero\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In language, sparsity is everywhere, since _most utterances don't use most features._  So if we want to categorize any non-trivial corpus of language data, we'll need a _lot_ of features, but most of them won't appear in most of our utterances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparsity is bad.  It makes models have less data to work with for finding patterns, and thus, models will tend to overfit--they'll fit very well to the _current data,_ but will generalize poorly to new data.  Thus, almost all of the work in NLP is actually geared at finding ways to reduce sparsity in language data."

    "This means that models love data.  More data is better than less, and will make better models, since they're ultimately statistically-based models.\n",

    "But more data means more computing time.  So, we strive to build models that balance computational efficiency against power and accuracy.  As it turns out, one of the best ways to do this is to get a basic, but working, model of language, and just train it on a massive dataset.  Your results may not be perfectly accurate for every single document, but they should be pretty accurate for the whole dataset, and generally accurate for most documents, if you do it right.\n",

I.e., ignore syntax, ignore pragmatics, ignore even semantics--just count words.\n",

    "When we're doing a word-counting type analysis, remember that we're trying to get at a dense representation of the _content_ of our data.  Some common preprocessing steps to that end are:\n",
    "* Convert to lowercase\n",
    "* (Sometimes, but not always) De-accent characters, e.g. convert \"â\" to \"a\".\n",
    "* Tokenize, i.e. split a doucment into a list of tokens (words, punctuation, etc)\n",
    "* Remove tokens:\n",
    "  * _Stopwords_ (generally, _function_ words), e.g. \"the\", \"a\", \"to\", etc.\n",
    "  * Words with very low frequencies (contain very little information, and are not useful)\n",
    "  * Words with extremely high _document-wise_ frequencies (these don't help us discriminate between documents in our corpus)\n",
    "* Stem, or lemmatize, the text (not always--depends on the analysis!)\n",
    "  * Stemming is significantly faster, but lemmatization can be more accurate.\n",
    "  * But for downstream tasks and analysis, both stemming and lemmatization tend to perform about the same.\n",
    "* Find multi-word phrases\n",

    "\n",
    "For other analyses (rather than just counting words), we might be interested in preserving more sophisticated, perhaps structural, features of the text:\n",
    "* Identifying (named) entities\n",
    "* Identifying noun chunks (more or less NPs/DPs)\n",
    "* Syntactic parsing (dependency and constituent parsing are most common)\n",
    "* Part-of-speech tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the actual analyses we might do, they are many:\n",
    "* Topic modeling\n",

    "We can use the two excellent libraries we've already seen: spaCy and Gensim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim is a much _faster_ library for preprocessing, since it only operates based on raw string patterns and is designed to be fast and scale to massive datasets.  There is the assumption that any error we induce through the very simplistic approaches will be balanced out by the amount of data we work with--generally a good, and correct, assumption.  Gensim does no syntactic parsing, POS tagging, or other such structure-related analysis, but it's not designed for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy is the much _more accurate_ library, since it parses text based on large, powerful pre-trained models (think Stanford's CoreNLP toolkit--it's very much analogous to that).  While still very fast, spaCy is painfully slow compared to Gensim.  But, it has a far more robust tokenizer, it can do part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, dependency parsing, entity and noun chunk identification, and it even has pre-trained word vectors (and can easily compute vectors for strings of words or entire documents)."

    "Topic Modeling refers to a wide variety of algorithms that are used to explore and discover \"topics\" within a corpus.  \"Topic\" is being used with a very specific meaning here--a topic is a _statistical distribution of words_.  You might already be familiar with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA; sometimes called Latent Semantic Indexing, or LSI), which is an older model for this sort of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern algorithms are based on [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf), which uses word co-occurrences within documents to determine the topics.  LDA has given rise to a number of subsequent topic models: \n",
    "* Author-Topic models, which are LDA with metadata (usually, but not always, the author of a piece)\n",
    "* Dynamic topic models, which include time metadata in the modeling process\n",
    "* Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, an extension of LDA that is _nonparametric_ with regards to the number of topics (but can give less clear results in some cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these models are implemented in Genim.  Due to the size of our corpus and the fact that this is a live demo, we'll use Gensim's speedier preprocessing tools to work with our data and prepate it for topic modeling.  And we'll only show LDA, since the others do the same basic thing and look basically the same in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim requires that the corpus be in a _bag of words_ format for topic modeling, so we'll need to put our documents in that format first.  Fortunately this requires little code: just do our preprocessing, then use some pre-built tools from Gensim to do the rest."

These embeddings--while not yet well-suited to extracting word similarities and meanings from large bodies of unlabeled text--show an extreme aptitude for embedding _graph_- and _network_-like data, e.g. WordNet, and can capture various relations like hypernymy/hyponymy and synonymy quite well.
