    "    * \"There should be one, and preferably only one, obvious way to do it.\"  I.e., the most straightforward approach is _usually_ the best.  (This results in a lot of people writing straightforward, fairly easy-to-follow code).\n",

    "## Phrase-finding/collocation analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Ngrams are fun and all, but what if you want to find multi-word phrases that appear more often than they should by random chance alone (i.e., collocates)?  Well, as before, we could hack a bit of code together, or we could use a pre-built tool from the amazing Gensin library: the [Phrasing tools!](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/phrases.html)  These tools let you scan a(n already processed) corpus of texts, and finds bigrams that are collocated more than the raw prior distributions would indicate.  Then, these tools let you transform your original corpus, replacing these bigrams with a single token.  You can repeat this process all you want to find arbitrarily long phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing this, we should run our text through a basic preprocessing pipeline in Gensim.  We'll revisit this in a bit more detail later to talk about what it does; for now, just know that it automates a lot of the basic preprocessing steps for us, like lowercasing, removing stopwords, stemming, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use all the default values for our phrasing models except for the threshold (to guarnatee we find at least _some_ phrases for this demo), but they'll be provided explicitly to show how much customization there is.  Note that the phraser expectes a _list of sentences_, i.e. a _list of lists of words._  We don't strictly need to make them the actual sentences; the only reason Gensim says to use sentences is to avoid collocation across sentence boundaries."

Plus I'm doing homework, PLUS I'm watching Law & Order...how massively talented am I? Well, my day was pretty kick butt. Umm, no band OR music theory...very cool, so Kristen and I sat together and did homework and discussed Winter. Next period I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (Alex too for a bit, since he was in Gym) and I left eventually. They started working on music, and...I just always end up feeling left out when they do, so, I try to stay away from those two together in general.Oh well, I went and sat alone in a practice room. Darn...no good stories for the newspaper to write about me. That was a great story, no matter how angry people are about the band comment. I wish people would have read the story actually, instead of reaching paragraph two and deciding it was terrible. Well, anyway, umm...EPVM was interesting. I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother said it was difficult...my brother with the perfect ACT AND SAT scores...arg. I just...wow, I'm so afraid of that test. I'm completely going to fail. Gym...oh jeez...two words  Commando Crawl  OWWWWWWWWWWWWWW  Good lord...that was one of the most painful...oh jeez...just thinking about it. Seriously, if you ever by some chance do that for high ropes...WEAR PANTS! Well, yes...wear pants normally, but don't wear shorts, make sure they are pants, because...it's quite painful if you don't. I made it through though, so it's all good! It just hurt...a lot.   Math, boring, shock shock.  Intervening thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex??  Lunch...was interesting. Just hung out with Kelly and Emily some, then Chris and Alex. It was cool...not much to it. Comparative Religion was boring...just, meh, presenting projects...and finally chem...boring, shock shock, and then, I came home, and did stuff, and that is the end of my day...therefore, I shall leave, and go kill alex...I mean...wait...you know NOTHING.

    "spaCy is the much _more accurate_ library, since it parses text based on large, powerful pre-trained models (think Stanford's CoreNLP toolkit--it's very much analogous to that).  While still very fast, spaCy is painfully slow compared to Gensim.  But, it has a far more robust tokenizer, it can do part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, dependency parsing, entity and noun chunk identification, and it even has pre-trained word vectors (and can easily compute vectors for strings of words or entire documents).\n",

There's one function--`gensim.parsing.preprocessing.preprocess_string()`--which encompasses all the basic functions we need: lowercasing, de-accenting, tokenizing, stemming (with the Porter stemmer), stopword removal, removal of numbers, and removal of very short words (which are generally noise to use)."

    "\n",
    "Topic Modeling refers to a wide variety of algorithms that are used to explore and discover \"topics\" within a corpus.  \"Topic\" is being used with a very specific meaning here--a topic is a _statistical distribution of words_.  You might already be familiar with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA; sometimes called Latent Semantic Indexing, or LSI), which is an older model for this sort of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern algorithms are based on [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf), which uses word co-occurrences within documents to determine the topics.  LDA has given rise to a number of subsequent topic models: \n",
    "* Author-Topic models, which are LDA with metadata (usually, but not always, the author of a piece)\n",
    "* Dynamic topic models, which include time metadata in the modeling process\n",
    "* Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, an extension of LDA that is _nonparametric_ with regards to the number of topics (but can give less clear results in some cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these models are implemented in Genim.  Due to the size of our corpus and the fact that this is a live demo, we'll use Gensim's speedier preprocessing tools to work with our data and prepate it for topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim requires that the corpus be in a _bag of words_ format for topic modeling, so we'll need to put our documents in that format first.  Fortunately this requires little code: just do our preprocessing, then use some pre-built tools from Gensim to do the rest."

We won't bother tweaking any of the default settings (except for chunksize, which should give us a bit more speed), meaning each one will search for 100 topics.  This is the most important parameter in the models, by far--and sadly, the only really good way to find a good value is to run it at a range of different topic numbers and see what gives you useful results.  You _can_ look at the _coherence_ of each topic (calculated by Gensum automatically) and use that to evaluate your model, but the be-all-end-all is the human interpretability and the usefulness of your topics.\n",

    "\n",
    "Word embeddings have absolutely taken over the entire field of NLP, starting with Mikolov et al's 2013 paper on [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781).  The basic idea of these embeddings:\n",
    "* Some notion of \"meaning\" is recoverable from the _contexts_ that a word occurs in\n",
    "* It is possible to generate a _vector_ representation of a word such that _words appearing in similar contexts have similar vectors_ (or, more intuitively, \"are close to each other\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors are used for almost every kind of task: document scoring and classification, sentiment analysis, document and word clustering, machine translation (though less commmonly), and more.  Plus, they've been demonstrated to excel at a number of lexical similarity and analogy tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim has an impelementation of Word2Vec that we can use on our corpus.  spaCy, meanwhile, comes pre-bundled with word vectors computed using Stanford's GloVe algorithm (which works differently under the hood, but in terms of how well the vectors actually perform in any application, is basically identical).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief aside: Poincare Embeddings\n",
    "In May 2017, Maximilian Nickel and Douwe Kiela published an extremely exciting paper on embeddings performed in _hyperbolic space_ rather than _Euclidean space_ (all prior models were in Euclidean space).  These embeddings--while not yet well-suited to extracting word similarities and meanings from large bodies of unlabeled text--show an extreme aptitude for embedding _graph_- and _network_-like data, e.g. WordNet, and can capture various relations like hypernymy/hyponymy and synonymy quite well.  Keep an eye on \"Poincare Embeddings\"--lots of interesting things are sure to happen there soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### spaCy word vectors\n",
    "We'll work with spaCy's pre-trained vectors just for time's sake--training word2vec models in Gensim is surprisingly fast, but we'll be doing basically the same thing downstream.  First, as always, we need to load our data and our model.  We'll just use a single blog post, and we'll turn off a bunch of the spaCy parsing stuff for speed."

    "Since we have vectors representing documents (we can also use the bag-of-words representation for this, too!), we can do any classical statistical test or modelling we want, like trying to build a model to predict the age of a post's author from its contents, or predicting their astrological sign.  But we won't use statistics, because we have tools better suited to the tasks at hand: machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without getting too deep in the weeds, machine learning models are essentially extensions of statistics that are based on _computational mathematics_ rather than _classical mathematics_.  They tend to scale better to massive datasets (i.e. run faster and predict better) and are often more powerful for pure prediction, but they are designed for larger datasets and may not work well at lower sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, ultimately, the distinction between \"machine learning\" and \"statistics\" is a false one.  The real difference is \"experimentalists\" (who seek to understand _causation_) and \"data miners,\" who only want to build models with good _predictive power_.  (I won't get any further into this--but Leo Breiman's 2001 paper [Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726) is an interesting exploration of this divide).\n",

    "Python has some absoltuely top-tier machine learning libraries: Scikit-Learn for non-neural models (e.g. decision trees, random forests, support vector machines), and various environments like Keras, Tensorflow, and Pytorch for building neural networks.  We'll use non-neural models for this demo--they both run faster (as in, by a factor of days, sometimes) and are _much_ easier to interpret.\n",

    "We'll build four models, using two different sets of target variables and two different sets of predictors.\n",

    "Predictors: document vectors, generated by spaCy; bag-of-words model with tf-idf weighting.\n",

We'll use a _linear support vector machine kernel._  SVM's can have different _kernel functions_ that apply some transforms to the data--linear is far and away the fastest one commonly used, but others (like Radial Basis Function kernels, or RBF) can have higher performance, but simply will not run in any reasonably period of time for most use cases.\n",
