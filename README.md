# PythonForLinguistsTalk
Notebooks and sample data from my Python for Linguists talk at UTA (Feb 14th, 2018).

# Running this notebook

To run this notebook, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
* Jupyter (to run/view the notebook itself)
* Gensim
* spaCy
  * You'll need to download two of spaCy's language models: `en_core_web_sm` and `en_core_web_lg`.  Installation instructions are [here.](https://spacy.io/models/)
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn (goes by sklearn when installing)
* Matplotlib
* Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

For the first part of the talk, you'll also need to download `glen carrig.txt` from the Github repository and have it in the same folder as this notebook.

For the second part of the talk, you'll need to download the [Blog Authorship Corpus](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm) and unzip its files into a folder named "blogs" (case-sensitive) in the same folder as this notebook.
