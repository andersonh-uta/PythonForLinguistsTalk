    "Ngrams are fun and all, but what if you want to find multi-word phrases that appear more often than they should by random chance alone (i.e., collocates)?  Well, as before, we could hack a bit of code together, or we could use a pre-built tool from the amazing Gensin library: the [Phrasing tools!](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/phrases.html)  These tools let you scan a(n already processed) corpus of texts, and finds bigrams that are collocated more than the raw prior distributions would indicate.  Then, these tools let you transform your original corpus, replacing these bigrams with a single token.  You can repeat this process all you want to find arbitrarily long phrases.\n",

    "Before doing this, we should run our text through a basic preprocessing pipeline in Gensim.  We'll revisit this in a bit more detail later to talk about what it does; for now, just know that it automates a lot of the basic preprocessing steps for us, like lowercasing, removing stopwords, stemming, etc.\n",

Note that the phraser expectes a _list of sentences_, i.e. a _list of lists of words._  We don't strictly need to make them the actual sentences; the only reason Gensim says to use sentences is to avoid collocation across sentence boundaries."

Plus I'm doing homework, PLUS I'm watching Law & Order...how massively talented am I? Well, my day was pretty kick butt. Umm, no band OR music theory...very cool, so Kristen and I sat together and did homework and discussed Winter. Next period I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (Alex too for a bit, since he was in Gym) and I left eventually. They started working on music, and...I just always end up feeling left out when they do, so, I try to stay away from those two together in general.Oh well, I went and sat alone in a practice room. Darn...no good stories for the newspaper to write about me. That was a great story, no matter how angry people are about the band comment. I wish people would have read the story actually, instead of reaching paragraph two and deciding it was terrible. Well, anyway, umm...EPVM was interesting. I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother said it was difficult...my brother with the perfect ACT AND SAT scores...arg. I just...wow, I'm so afraid of that test. I'm completely going to fail. Gym...oh jeez...two words  Commando Crawl  OWWWWWWWWWWWWWW  Good lord...that was one of the most painful...oh jeez...just thinking about it. Seriously, if you ever by some chance do that for high ropes...WEAR PANTS! Well, yes...wear pants normally, but don't wear shorts, make sure they are pants, because...it's quite painful if you don't. I made it through though, so it's all good! It just hurt...a lot.   Math, boring, shock shock.  Intervening thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex??  Lunch...was interesting. Just hung out with Kelly and Emily some, then Chris and Alex. It was cool...not much to it. Comparative Religion was boring...just, meh, presenting projects...and finally chem...boring, shock shock, and then, I came home, and did stuff, and that is the end of my day...therefore, I shall leave, and go kill alex...I mean...wait...you know NOTHING.

    "NLP is fundamentally a branch of machine learning (ML) that focuses just on language data.  As such, it inherits a lot of ideas and concerns from ML.  One of the biggest ones is _sparsity_.  Sparsity is the phenomenon of having a lot of features with \"null\" values for a lot of your observations (this usually manifests as \"missing data\" or \"zero\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In language, sparsity is everywhere, since _most utterances don't use most features._  So if we want to categorize any non-trivial corpus of language data, we'll need a _lot_ of features, but most of them won't appear in most of our utterances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparsity is bad.  It makes models have less data to work with for finding patterns, and thus, models will tend to overfit--they'll fit very well to the _current data,_ but will generalize poorly to new data.  Thus, almost all of the work in NLP is actually geared at finding ways to reduce sparsity in language data."

Your results may not be perfectly accurate for every single document, but they should be pretty accurate for the whole dataset, and generally accurate for most documents, if you do it right.\n",

There is the assumption that any error we induce through the very simplistic approaches will be balanced out by the amount of data we work with--generally a good, and correct, assumption.  Gensim does no syntactic parsing, POS tagging, or other such structure-related analysis, but it's not designed for that.\n",

While still very fast, spaCy is painfully slow compared to Gensim.  But, it has a far more robust tokenizer, it can do part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, dependency parsing, entity and noun chunk identification, and it even has pre-trained word vectors (and can easily compute vectors for strings of words or entire documents)."

    "## Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings have absolutely taken over the entire field of NLP, starting with Mikolov et al's 2013 paper on [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781).  The basic idea of these embeddings:\n",
    "* Some notion of \"meaning\" is recoverable from the _contexts_ that a word occurs in\n",
    "* It is possible to generate a _vector_ representation of a word such that _words appearing in similar contexts have similar vectors_ (or, more intuitively, \"are close to each other\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors are used for almost every kind of task: document scoring and classification, sentiment analysis, document and word clustering, machine translation (though less commmonly), and more.  Plus, they've been demonstrated to excel at a number of lexical similarity and analogy tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim has an impelementation of Word2Vec that we can use on our corpus.  spaCy, meanwhile, comes pre-bundled with word vectors computed using Stanford's GloVe algorithm (which works differently under the hood, but in terms of how well the vectors actually perform in any application, is basically identical).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief aside: Poincare Embeddings\n",
    "In May 2017, Maximilian Nickel and Douwe Kiela published [an extremely exciting paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08039) on embeddings performed in _hyperbolic space_ rather than _Euclidean space_ (all prior models were in Euclidean space).  These embeddings--while not yet well-suited to extracting word similarities and meanings from large bodies of unlabeled text--show an extreme aptitude for embedding _graph_- and _network_-like data, e.g. WordNet, and can capture various relations like hypernymy/hyponymy and synonymy quite well.  Keep an eye on \"Poincare Embeddings\"--lots of interesting things are sure to happen there soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### spaCy word vectors\n",
    "We'll work with spaCy's pre-trained vectors just for time's sake--training word2vec models in Gensim is surprisingly fast, but we'll be doing basically the same thing downstream.  First, as always, we need to load our data and our model.  We'll just use a single blog post, and we'll turn off a bunch of the spaCy parsing stuff for speed."

But we won't use statistics, because we have tools better suited to the specifics of the tasks at hand: machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without getting too deep in the weeds, machine learning models are essentially extensions of statistics that are based on _computational mathematics_ rather than _classical mathematics_.  They tend to scale better to massive datasets (i.e. run faster and predict better) and are often more powerful for pure prediction, but they are designed for larger datasets and may not work well at lower sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, ultimately, the distinction between \"machine learning\" and \"statistics\" is a false one.  The real difference is \"experimentalists\" (who seek to understand _causation_) and \"data miners,\" who only want to build models with good _predictive power_.  (I won't get any further into this--but Leo Breiman's 2001 paper [Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726) is an interesting exploration of this divide).\n",

We'll use non-neural models for this demo--they both run faster (as in, by a factor of days, sometimes) and are _much_ easier to interpret.\n",

SVMs strike a nice balance between speed (though there are faster models) and performance (though there are more powerful models), and are always a good go-to.  For binary classification tasks, they're still among the best models around.  Specifically, we'll use SVMs with a _linear kernel_--don't worry for now about the impelementation details of that, just know that a linear kernel SVM runs faster than other kinds, and is often plenty good for most tasks.\n",
