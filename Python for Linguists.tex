Linguists}\label{python-and-nlp-for-linguists}}

I'm going to try something novel: giving this talk from a Jupyter
notebook so I can run code on the fly.

While I was writing up this notebook, this talk turned into a broad
introduction to NLP as well as Python. Oh well.

  \item
    CSS is currently exploding, and is a hugely important avenue for
    applied social science research.

\item
  (Quite literally) infinite control over your data processing: you're
  not limited by the features someone else decided to code into their
  program--you can change your code up to do anything you want.
\item
  Scalability and automation of your data work

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Work with literally millions of documents and billions of words with
    relative ease.
  \item
    Automate steps from data collection through final analysis.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Some types of analysis simply are infeasible to do by hand--network
  analysis, topic modeling, word embeddings, etc--and \emph{have} to be
  done computationally.
\item
  Marketable skills: even a little bit of Python, Java, or any other
  language can open doors in the job market.
\item
  You'll feel like a badass.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{What does \emph{Python}
offer?}{What does Python offer?}}\label{what-does-python-offer}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Free (as in speech, not beer. But also as in beer), open-source,
  royalty-free. No licenses to sign, no royalties to pay, and
  \emph{essentially no restrictions} on what you can and can't do with
  it. (the \href{https://docs.python.org/3/license.html}{Python Software
  Foundation license} is an extremely permissive BSD-type license)
\item
  Easy-to-learn language.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Very user-friendly language with very friendly users.
  \item
    Great documentation and stupid amounts of free, high-quality
    learning resources.
  \item
    Among its core ideas:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Code is read far more than it is written, so the language should
      be \emph{human-readable.}
    \item
      ``There should be one, and preferably only one, obvious way to do
      it.'' I.e., the most straightforward approach is \emph{usually}
      the best. (This results in a lot of people writing
      straightforward, fairly easy-to-follow code).
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Commonly taught as a first programming language, so there are LOTS
    of materials for eveyone from beginning programmers to seasoned
    professionals; the Python community is also very welcoming of
    newcomers.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  General purpose language: can do (almost) everything you want to make
  it to.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Compare to R, which is great for statistics, and a pain for a lot of
    other stuff.
  \item
    Or Matlab, which is great for being a broken, slow, difficult
    software environment, and isn't so good at being, well, good.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      (this has been your mandatory ``Matlab is bad'' comment)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Rapidly becoming \emph{the} language for data science, displacing even
  R in most applications. (R is still dominant for raw statistics,
  though Python has plenty of packages that implement common statistical
  tests).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Though, keep an eye on a different language--Julia--over the next
    few years. It is truly a worthy contender, but has yet to hit
    version 1.0 as of this talk.
  \end{itemize}

  functionality and libraries.

\section{Running this notebook}\label{running-this-notebook}}

To run this notebook, you will need to install the following Python
libraries: * Jupyter (to run/view the notebook itself) * Gensim * spaCy
* You'll need to download two of spaCy's language models:
\texttt{en\_core\_web\_sm} and \texttt{en\_core\_web\_lg}. Installation
instructions are \href{https://spacy.io/models/}{here.} * Numpy *
Scikit-learn (goes by sklearn when installing) * Matplotlib * Natural
Language Toolkit (NLTK) * tqdm * Pandas

Open Jupyter and navigate to this .ipynb file, then open it. Every major
section is designed to be able to run independently, minus the ``Setup
Code'' section, which should always be run first.

For the first part of the talk, you'll also need to download
\texttt{glen\ carrig.txt} from the Github repository and have it in the
same folder as this notebook.

For the second part of the talk, you'll need to download the
\href{http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm}{Blog Authorship
Corpus} and unzip its files into a folder named ``blogs''
(case-sensitive) in the same folder as this notebook.

\subsection{Concordances}\label{concordances}}

    Concordances can be done with regular expressions and a teeny tiny bit
of legwork. (By the way: if you're working with text, you have no excuse
to not learn regular expressions. But that would be another talk all
unto itself). We'll work with the text of William Hope Hodgeson's novel
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boats_of_the_\%22Glen_Carrig\%22}{\emph{The
Boats of the ``Glen Carrig''}}, a 1907 horror novel. The text was taken
\href{http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10542}{from Project Gutenberg},
with the site's boilerplate text removed from the front and back.

    And if we want to get \emph{really} clever, we can have our concordance
function search by stemmed forms. We'll revisit stemming in a bit more
detail shortly; for now, just know that stemming is the process of
determining an uninflected form of words, but it's based purely on
character patterns--so each word is treated completely in isolation,
with no information about parts of speech.

We need to stem the original text, then search for concordances of any
tokens that get stemmed to the same value as our input. Then we run the
previous concordance function on those tokens:

    That added less than a second to the total runtime. Nice.

Now let's do it again, but with spaCy instead of Gensim. spaCy has
built-in tokenization, lemmatization, and more that are all based on
large, pre-trained machine learning models. This will give us much
better accuracy--both with tokenizing and lemmatizing--but at the cost
of higher runtime. spaCy also has multiple models to choose from--for
English, there's small, medium, and large. The bigger the model, the
better its accuracy, but also the slower it runs. But since the
interface is exactly the same, we'll use the small model for speed. (the
small model is pretty darn good, anyways)

We'll also revisit lemmatization in a bit more detail shortly. The short
version: it's like stemming, but it returns a valid, real word
corresponding to the uninflected form of a token. (unlike stemming,
which might map ``today'' to the root form ``todai''--lemmatization
would correctly map this to ``today'').

{\ldots} our leaving, he had given no thought to take them with him;{\ldots}
{\ldots}n here, how that I had little thought all this while for the{\ldots}
{\ldots}aving no tides; but I had not thought to come upon such an o{\ldots}
{\ldots}estion, I grew full of solemn thought; for it seemed to me t{\ldots}
{\ldots}e like for the moment to have thought he had seen a second d{\ldots}
{\ldots}ght by the weed; and then the thought came to me of the end {\ldots}
{\ldots}quito will make; but I had no thought to blame any mosquito{\ldots}
{\ldots}rooted them. At least, so the thought came to me. And so we {\ldots}
{\ldots}er while than hitherto he had thought needful. Having conclu{\ldots}
{\ldots}s further ahead: but I had no thought for these when I perce{\ldots}
{\ldots}de. Then, having by this time thought a little upon the matt{\ldots}
{\ldots}is liking. But it must not be thought that he did naught but{\ldots}
{\ldots}y an enormous crab. Now I had thought the crab we had tried {\ldots}
{\ldots}ll breakers--which we had not thought needful to carry to th{\ldots}
{\ldots}zon, and there would come the thought to me of the terror of{\ldots}
{\ldots}hen, even as I fell upon this thought, the bo'sun clapped me{\ldots}
{\ldots}n in cooler minds, we had not thought strange, seeing that s{\ldots}
{\ldots}ed too sincerely to have much thought to watch the hulk, whi{\ldots}
{\ldots}were become so excited at the thought of fellow creatures al{\ldots}
{\ldots}he rope to us, and at this we thought more upon his saying; {\ldots}
{\ldots} happy to tell that we had no thought at this juncture but f{\ldots}
{\ldots}to a method of rescue. Then a thought came to me (waked perc{\ldots}
{\ldots} me a short spell of disquiet thought. It was in this wise:-{\ldots}
{\ldots}n such a sight, and indeed, I thought nothing more of it tha{\ldots}
{\ldots}ls, and further, I could have thought I perceived a flicker {\ldots}
{\ldots}ed it at all such parts as he thought in any way doubtful, a{\ldots}
{\ldots}tion, and then, suddenly, the thought came to me that the sc{\ldots}
{\ldots}w I was made to understand my thought of the previous night,{\ldots}
{\ldots}the first, and then, a sudden thought coming to me, I thrust{\ldots}
{\ldots}t remained hid. Then a sudden thought came into my brain, an{\ldots}
{\ldots}y, as a result of some little thought, he brought out from t{\ldots}
{\ldots}fore the evening. And, at the thought of this, we experience{\ldots}
{\ldots} the lesser rope; for that he thought they in the ship were {\ldots}
{\ldots}t break it, and then a second thought that something might b{\ldots}
{\ldots}ted within myself at this new thought, as, indeed, was the b{\ldots}
{\ldots}ly officer remaining to them, thought there might be good ch{\ldots}
{\ldots}ened the rope so much as they thought proper, they left it t{\ldots}
{\ldots}rface, and, at that, a sudden thought came to me which sent {\ldots}
{\ldots}her; but that I, for my part, thought rather the better, see{\ldots}
{\ldots}d which had beset them at the thought that they should all o{\ldots}
{\ldots}such interest since, that the thought of food had escaped me{\ldots}
{\ldots}r to have stayed, the which I thought, for a moment, had not{\ldots}
{\ldots}as very terrible, this sudden thought of failure (though it {\ldots}
{\ldots}ing gear about it, so that he thought it would be so safe as{\ldots}
{\ldots}of us in the ship that he had thought to go at that moment; {\ldots}
{\ldots}bo'sun bade him keep silence, thinking it was but a piece of{\ldots}
{\ldots}ithering sounds. And at that, thinking a host of evil things{\ldots}
{\ldots}nation, we turned to descend, thinking that this would be th{\ldots}
{\ldots}h I spent much of my watch in thinking over the details of m{\ldots}
{\ldots} men had caught their fish--, thinking that, if Tompkins had{\ldots}
{\ldots}he proceeded to explain that, thinking they were cut off fro{\ldots}
{\ldots}that land. For, indeed, now I think of it, I can remember th{\ldots}
{\ldots}, indeed, we had ever need to think more of such. And then, {\ldots}
{\ldots}ces on my throat he seemed to think but little, suggesting t{\ldots}
{\ldots}e; so that I knew not what to think, being near to doubting {\ldots}
{\ldots}rawling in the valley. Yet, I think the silences tried us th{\ldots}
{\ldots}her, and further than this, I think with truth I may say, we{\ldots}

\subsection{N-gram frequencies}\label{n-gram-frequencies}}

Python has a number of ways we could find n-grams. The first is using a
pre-built tool, like NLTK's ngrams() function, or a Phrases()/Phraser()
combination from Gensim, which are actually used to find multi-word
phrases. Or, we could hack it together ourselves with a few lines of
code.

First, let's hack it together ourselves. Then we'll print out the top
most common N-grams and plot the frequencies by rank (on a logarithmic
scale, naturally. We're not monsters, after all). We'll use spaCy's
tokenization for maximum accuracy.

First, we'll tokenize our document and convert everything to lowercase
using spaCy. We'll also remove punctuation and stopwords while we're at
it.

\subsection{Phrase-finding/collocation
analysis}\label{phrase-findingcollocation-analysis}}

Ngrams are fun and all, but what if you want to find multi-word phrases
that appear more often than they should by random chance alone (i.e.,
collocates)? Well, as before, we could hack a bit of code together, or
we could use a pre-built tool from the amazing Gensin library: the
\href{https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/phrases.html}{Phrasing
tools!} These tools let you scan a(n already processed) corpus of texts,
and finds bigrams that are collocated more than the raw prior
distributions would indicate. Then, these tools let you transform your
original corpus, replacing these bigrams with a single token. You can
repeat this process all you want to find arbitrarily long phrases.

Before doing this, we should run our text through a basic preprocessing
pipeline in Gensim. We'll revisit this in a bit more detail later to
talk about what it does; for now, just know that it automates a lot of
the basic preprocessing steps for us, like lowercasing, removing
stopwords, stemming, etc.

We'll use all the default values for our phrasing models except for the
threshold (to guarnatee we find at least \emph{some} phrases for this
demo), but they'll be provided explicitly to show how much customization
there is. Note that the phraser expectes a \emph{list of sentences},
i.e.~a \emph{list of lists of words.} We don't strictly need to make
them the actual sentences; the only reason Gensim says to use sentences
is to avoid collocation across sentence boundaries.

    And, we can transform our original document(s), replacing all of the
discovered bigrams with a single token (e.g.,
\texttt{{[}"the",\ boat"{]}} --\textgreater{} \texttt{"the\_boat"}).
Gensim likes to use the indexing syntax to do transformations--it's a
bit weird but you get used to it.

Note that we'll get a warning from Gensim (warnings are not
errors--they're more of a ``heads up, something looks weird here'' sort
of notice). Gensim also has Phraser() objects, which are initialized
from a Phrases() object, and are much faster at transforming a corpus.
This only really matters when you're dealing with \emph{massive} corpora
and datasets; for our single book, we don't really need to bother, but
I'll show how it would be done anyways.

\section{Some more fun demos: Natural Language Processing
101}\label{some-more-fun-demos-natural-language-processing-101}}

Now, let's do some more interesting demos. These will focus on more
sophisticated (but still ``entry-level'') NLP techniques and tools.

We will: * Go from raw data to cleaned, workable text. * Look at some of
spaCy and Gensim's text (pre)processing tools * Do some basic topic
modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation * Do some basic classification
and regression tasks with some text.

    \hypertarget{getting-our-data}{%
\subsection{Getting our data}\label{getting-our-data}}

    The previous demos were very simple (even simplistic) and don't really
leverage all the cool stuff Python--or programming in general--can do
for you. Let's work with a non-trivial dataset now and do some more
NLP-like work. We'll use the
\href{http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm}{Blog Authorship
Corpus}. Download it to the same folder as this notebook, then unzip it
into a folder names ``blogs'' (case-sensitive!).

Each author's blog posts are stored as a .xml file, named in the
following format:

\texttt{{[}ID\ number{]}.{[}gender{]}.{[}age{]}.{[}industry\ of\ employment{]}.{[}astrological\ sign{]}.xml}

E.g., \texttt{11253.male.26.Technology.Aquarius.xml}

And they contain blog data that looks like this:

    ``` 20,July,2004

\begin{verbatim}
  About to go t bed late (again) got sucked into (another) late night film. Tonight was  urlLink Maybe Baby . It was really good made me think, but not about babies. The guy screws up his marriage and it made me think about making sure, everyday, that mine is tip top. If I'm honest there are areas that we are just getting by in - so I need to resolve to sort them out now before they are a problem. In the film they both keep diaries so I thought I should blog tonight.&nbsp;   Weekend was hectic but great fun. Not that long ago k and I had to work on spending time with other people as a couple. This weekend we never ate alone, except breakfast.&nbsp; K, P and I went for a very breif trip on the river saturday durring a gap in the weather. K stripped off and went for a swim, I love her so much.&nbsp;   Tonight we went out for dinner. It was a lovely evening, the first in weeks, so we ate at the Bridge and sat outside, next to the  urlLink river .     
 
\end{verbatim}

 ```

    First thing's first: we need to deal with the XML formatting.
Fortunately, Python has some excellent tools for that, e.g.
\texttt{xml.etree.ElementTree}. We'll also want to use a better data
structure to represent this text. There's an absolutely indispensible
library called Pandas, which gives you R-style dataframes to work with
(and Pandas is probably the single biggest reason that Python has taken
over the data science world, demoting R to second-place).

    Uh-oh. Let's take a look at the file that broke and go see where the
problem is. Fortunately, the error above gave us a line \emph{and} a
column number, so we can go to the exact location where an issue was
encountered.

      Hehe, just finished dinner! Yum! I'm so happy right now. I don't even know why, I just...am! I'm talking to a bunch of my friends while writing this, which is always fun. Plus I'm doing homework, PLUS I'm watching Law & Order...how massively talented am I? Well, my day was pretty kick butt. Umm, no band OR music theory...very cool, so Kristen and I sat together and did homework and discussed Winter. Next period I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (Alex too for a bit, since he was in Gym) and I left eventually. They started working on music, and...I just always end up feeling left out when they do, so, I try to stay away from those two together in general.Oh well, I went and sat alone in a practice room. Darn...no good stories for the newspaper to write about me. That was a great story, no matter how angry people are about the band comment. I wish people would have read the story actually, instead of reaching paragraph two and deciding it was terrible. Well, anyway, umm...EPVM was interesting. I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother said it was difficult...my brother with the perfect ACT AND SAT scores...arg. I just...wow, I'm so afraid of that test. I'm completely going to fail. Gym...oh jeez...two words  Commando Crawl  OWWWWWWWWWWWWWW  Good lord...that was one of the most painful...oh jeez...just thinking about it. Seriously, if you ever by some chance do that for high ropes...WEAR PANTS! Well, yes...wear pants normally, but don't wear shorts, make sure they are pants, because...it's quite painful if you don't. I made it through though, so it's all good! It just hurt...a lot.   Math, boring, shock shock.  Intervening thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex??  Lunch...was interesting. Just hung out with Kelly and Emily some, then Chris and Alex. It was cool...not much to it. Comparative Religion was boring...just, meh, presenting projects...and finally chem...boring, shock shock, and then, I came home, and did stuff, and that is the end of my day...therefore, I shall leave, and go kill alex...I mean...wait...you know NOTHING. You have no evidence...:)

    Column numbers aren't displayed in this notebook, but the error is at
the ampersand in \texttt{Law\ \&\ Order}. As it turns out, ampersands
are special characters in XML code, and need to be escaped specially (in
this case, as \texttt{\&amp;}). We could do some manual replacement of
characters with the appropriate XML escapes, but that sounds like a lot
of work and a lot of room for error.

Fortunately, our document structure is so simple that we can just hack
this together with regular expressions. This will be fast, but
\textbf{is not} how we should in general deal with problematic XML or
other markup files--we'd want to use some of Python's more rudimentary
tools, like the base HTML or XML parsers, and overwrite their
functionality (e.g.~by subclassing).

We'll create a list of dictionaries (think JSONs), which we can easily
pass into Pandas to make a big, beautiful, glorious Dataframe object
(which we'll save to a .csv so we can re-open it directly later). We'll
work with this Dataframe for most the rest of this demo.

We'll also create a second dataframe, where we only have one entry per
author, and concatenate all of their posts together. We'll use this at
the end of the talk for some regression and classification tasks where
we're predicting author-level variables, rather than working at the
document level.

    \hypertarget{the-big-challenge-sparsity}{%
\subsubsection{The big challenge:
Sparsity}\label{the-big-challenge-sparsity}}

NLP is fundamentally a branch of machine learning (ML) that focuses just
on language data. As such, it inherits a lot of ideas and concerns from
ML. One of the biggest ones is \emph{sparsity}. Sparsity is the
phenomenon of having a lot of features with ``null'' values for a lot of
your observations (this usually manifests as ``missing data'' or
``zero'').

In language, sparsity is everywhere, since \emph{most utterances don't
use most features.} So if we want to categorize any non-trivial corpus
of language data, we'll need a \emph{lot} of features, but most of them
won't appear in most of our utterances.

Sparsity is bad. It makes models have less data to work with for finding
patterns, and thus, models will tend to overfit--they'll fit very well
to the \emph{current data,} but will generalize poorly to new data.
Thus, almost all of the work in NLP is actually geared at finding ways
to reduce sparsity in language data.

    \hypertarget{data-at-scale}{%
\subsubsection{Data at scale}\label{data-at-scale}}

All of the models of language used in the NLP community are essentially
data-driven. Rules-based models are all but completely dead.

This means that models love data. More data is better than less, and
will make better models, since they're ultimately statistically-based
models.

But more data means more computing time. So, we strive to build models
that balance computational efficiency against power and accuracy. As it
turns out, one of the best ways to do this is to get a basic, but
working, model of language, and just train it on a massive dataset. Your
results may not be perfectly accurate for every single document, but
they should be pretty accurate for the whole dataset, and generally
accurate for most documents, if you do it right.

Bear in mind: computational approaches care about balancing precision
and recall, but they often come at the expense of the other.

    \hypertarget{a-good-enough-model-of-language-just-count-the-words}{%
\subsubsection{A good enough model of language*: Just count the
words!}\label{a-good-enough-model-of-language-just-count-the-words}}

* \emph{At least, for many basic purposes.}

One of the ways to deal with sparsity is to just ignore certain classes
of features and focus on a richer subset. As it turns out, we can do a
surprisingly large amount by ignoring every aspect of language except
for \emph{what lexical units are used} and \emph{how often they are
used}. I.e., ignore syntax, ignore pragmatics, ignore even
semantics--just count words.

It's a brutally simplistic model of language. But for many tasks, it
works, and it is useful. Consider: if my task is to find out ``what are
people talking about,'' e.g.~tracking discussions on Twitter at a large
scale, looking at the words used is probably going to be my fastest way
to get to that.

Equally important, this is a \emph{computationally} simple,
straightforward, and fast approach.

    \hypertarget{reducing-sparsity-through-preprocessing}{%
\subsubsection{Reducing sparsity through
preprocessing}\label{reducing-sparsity-through-preprocessing}}

One of the most important ways to reduce sparsity is through
preprocessing your data. We want to ``condense'' the data down to a
still meaningful representation that irons out all the noise. E.g., we
often want everything to be in the same casee, because computers think
that ``WORD'' (in uppercase) is different from ``word'', ``Word'',
``WoRd'', etc, and does not see any similarities between these tokens
unless we explicitly tell it.

When we're doing a word-counting type analysis, remember that we're
trying to get at a dense representation of the \emph{content} of our
data. Some common preprocessing steps to that end are: * Convert to
lowercase * (Sometimes, but not always) De-accent characters,
e.g.~convert ``â'' to ``a''. * Tokenize, i.e.~split a doucment into a
list of tokens (words, punctuation, etc) * Remove tokens: *
\emph{Stopwords} (generally, \emph{function} words), e.g. ``the'',
``a'', ``to'', etc. * Words with very low frequencies (contain very
little information, and are not useful) * Words with extremely high
\emph{document-wise} frequencies (these don't help us discriminate
between documents in our corpus) * Stem, or lemmatize, the text (not
always--depends on the analysis!) * Stemming is significantly faster,
but lemmatization can be more accurate. * But for downstream tasks and
analysis, both stemming and lemmatization tend to perform about the
same. * Find multi-word phrases * This might add features, but those
features may be more meaningful than individual word counts.

In almost all cases, these steps are followed by generating a
\emph{vectorized} representation of the text--e.g.~Bag-of-Words,
Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, GloVe, etc. These vector representations can then be
used for any quantitative, statistical, or machine learning analyses,
e.g.~regressions and classifications.

For other analyses (rather than just counting words), we might be
interested in preserving more sophisticated, perhaps structural,
features of the text: * Identifying (named) entities * Identifying noun
chunks (more or less NPs/DPs) * Syntactic parsing (dependency and
constituent parsing are most common) * Part-of-speech tagging

As for the actual analyses we might do, they are many: * Topic modeling
* Document scoring/classification (e.g., author identification)

The rest of this notebook is a whirlwind tour through some of these
capabilities in Python.

    \hypertarget{preprocessing}{%
\subsection{Preprocessing}\label{preprocessing}}

We can use the two excellent libraries we've already seen: spaCy and
Gensim.

Gensim is a much \emph{faster} library for preprocessing, since it only
operates based on raw string patterns and is designed to be fast and
scale to massive datasets. There is the assumption that any error we
induce through the very simplistic approaches will be balanced out by
the amount of data we work with--generally a good, and correct,
assumption. Gensim does no syntactic parsing, POS tagging, or other such
structure-related analysis, but it's not designed for that.

spaCy is the much \emph{more accurate} library, since it parses text
based on large, powerful pre-trained models (think Stanford's CoreNLP
toolkit--it's very much analogous to that). While still very fast, spaCy
is painfully slow compared to Gensim. But, it has a far more robust
tokenizer, it can do part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, dependency
parsing, entity and noun chunk identification, and it even has
pre-trained word vectors (and can easily compute vectors for strings of
words or entire documents).

    \hypertarget{gensim}{%
\subsubsection{Gensim}\label{gensim}}

Let's first look at Gensim's preprocessing. There's one
function--\texttt{gensim.parsing.preprocessing.preprocess\_string()}--which
encompasses almost all the basic functions we need: lowercasing,
de-accenting, tokenizing, stemming (with the Porter stemmer algorithm),
stopword removal, removal of numbers, and removal of very short words
(which are generally noise to use).

We can also use the Phrases()/Phraser() objects we saw before to find
multi-word phrases with ease, though given the size of our demo post, we
won't see any show up. We probably want to do this \emph{after} we run
the main preprocessing.

    Notice how the Porter Stemmer finds the uninflected forms of words. It
bases its processing \emph{purely} on the \emph{letters of a word}. This
makes it fast, but it doesn't always give real words or the most correct
forms, e.g. \texttt{"morning"} --\textgreater{} \texttt{"morn"}, and
\texttt{"okay"} --\textgreater{} \texttt{"okai"}. But, for most text
mining or NLP tasks, this is actually not that big of an issue. This
only \emph{really} matters, in any practical sense, for human
interpretation--which, admittedly, is a non-trivial concern.

    \hypertarget{spacy}{%
\subsubsection{spaCy}\label{spacy}}

spaCy requires us to load models in, as we saw earlier when doing
stem-based concordancing. As before, we'll use their small English
model, but we would just change the model name in \texttt{spacy.load()}
if we wanted a different model. The small model will generally be a bit
faster, which is all we need for this demo's purposes.

As before, applying the spaCy pipeline is easy, though we do need to
manually filter our stopwords and punctuation with some explicit checks.
And as with the Gensim examples, we'll run the Phrases() model on our
post, though as before we won't see any changes.

    Notice how the processed text is much more \emph{human-readable} with
this approach (this is due to the use of a lemmatizer, rather than a
stemmer). While nice for reporting and inspecting results, the extra
overhead in runtime (not evident in this small example) might make this
an unreasonable proposition for large datasets if time is an issue. And,
as mentioned earlier, if you're doing an \emph{automated analysis} of
your text later, there isn't always a big difference, if any, in how
well stemming versus lemmatization performs.

    There's more that spaCy can do, and there are other models and libraries
available for doing this sort of automated parsing and annotation of
text (e.g., there are interfaces to Stanford's CoreNLP suite), but spaCy
is always a good bet since it's fast (for the amount of work it does),
pretty accurate, easy to use, and flexible.

\subsection{Topic Modeling}\label{topic-modeling}}

Topic Modeling refers to a wide variety of algorithms that are used to
explore and discover ``topics'' within a corpus. ``Topic'' is being used
with a very specific meaning here--a topic is a \emph{statistical
distribution of words}. You might already be familiar with Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA; sometimes called Latent Semantic Indexing, or
LSI), which is an older model for this sort of analysis.

Most modern algorithms are based on
\href{http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf}{Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)}, which uses word co-occurrences within
documents to determine the topics. LDA has given rise to a number of
subsequent topic models: * Author-Topic models, which are LDA with
metadata (usually, but not always, the author of a piece) * Dynamic
topic models, which include time metadata in the modeling process *
Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, an extension of LDA that is
\emph{nonparametric} with regards to the number of topics (but can give
less clear results in some cases).

All of these models are implemented in Genim. Due to the size of our
corpus and the fact that this is a live demo, we'll use Gensim's
speedier preprocessing tools to work with our data and prepate it for
topic modeling. And we'll only show LDA, since the others do the same
basic thing and look basically the same in code.

Gensim requires that the corpus be in a \emph{bag of words} format for
topic modeling, so we'll need to put our documents in that format first.
Fortunately this requires little code: just do our preprocessing, then
use some pre-built tools from Gensim to do the rest.

    Around this time we should also notice that we're using a \emph{huge}
amount of RAM. So much, in fact, that the computer might be close to
running out. (It turns out that it's almost entirely from the dataframe
still in memory, but let's just pretend for the moment that it's our
actual corpus). How do we deal with this? Simple: \emph{streaming.}
Gensim is built around the concept of working with data one chunk at a
time--so we can save our data to a file, then read one ``chunk'' of that
file at a time! When dealing with a few hundred, or a few thousand,
documents this isn't needed. But when dealing with \emph{millions} of
documents or more, it's absolutely required, unless you want to spend
thousands of dollars on extremely high-end computing hardware or cloud
computing time/space.

Our corpus doesn't actually require this. (The cell below will show it's
only using a few megabytes--perfectly reasonable). But we'll do it
anyways, just for demonstration's sake, since this same idea and
approach would scale up nicely.

    When re-reload the corpus, we'll see that it's \emph{much} smaller in
memory. This is because, using Gensim's tools, we're only looking at the
size of the \emph{thing that accesses the data,} but which does not
currently store any of the data--it's all in a file on disk.

Accessing data from disk will be slow, though. Even the fastest SSDs are
still at least 10x slower than even slow RAM. So our runtime will be
limited by \emph{disk access speed}. BUT, disk space is
\emph{significantly} cheaper than RAM space! At the time of writing, 16
gigabytes of RAM costs about \$200*. Meanwhile, \$200 can get you
between 7 and 10 \emph{terabytes} of hard drive space (less if you want
SSDs, though). So while reading corpora off disk is very slow, it lets
us work with \emph{much} larger datasets.

We can re-load the corpus and dictionary we just saved. The dictionary
didn't take up much memory at all, but saving a copy was a good idea
anyways. The corpus also didn't take much space.

*\emph{RAM prices are currently (as of early 2018) very highly inflated,
though; normally this much RAM should only cost about \$100. But the
point still stands: RAM is expensive, hard drives are dirt cheap.}

\subsubsection{Aside: spaCy bag-of-words
pipeline}\label{aside-spacy-bag-of-words-pipeline}}

We won't run this during this demo, but just for comparison, here's a
spaCy preprocessing pipeline that does the same thing. The only thing
that changes is the first pass through the corpus (the first
\texttt{corpus\ =\ {[}...{]}} bit)--the bag-of-words steps are as
before. The change is shown below--all the other code would be the same.

\begin{verbatim}
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm", disable=["parser", "tagger", "ner"])
corpus = [
    [
        i.lemma_
        for i in nlp(j)
        if i.is_stop == False
        and i.is_punct == False
    ]
    for j in tqdm(texts, desc="Preprocessing")
]
\end{verbatim}

When I ran this on my computer, it took about an hour and a half to run
(\textasciitilde{}200 documents per second), compared to the Gensim
pipeline which took about 11 minutes (\textasciitilde{}1000 documents
per second). Of course, if you remove the \texttt{disable} line, you'll
get much higher-quality results, but it will run about 10x slower
(\textasciitilde{}20 documents per second on my computer, nearly 12
hours total runtime).

However, given the size of the corpus we're working from, the
differences aren't actually that significant in terms of how they'll
affect our results, so we can go with the considerably faster Gensim
approach.

    \hypertarget{back-to-topic-models}{%
\subsubsection{Back to topic models}\label{back-to-topic-models}}

Now, let's run some of these topic models. We won't bother tweaking any
of the default settings (except for chunksize, which should give us a
bit more speed), meaning each one will search for 100 topics. This is
the most important parameter in the models, by far--and sadly, the only
really good way to find a good value is to run it at a range of
different topic numbers and see what gives you useful results. You
\emph{can} look at the \emph{coherence} of each topic (calculated by
Gensum automatically) and use that to evaluate your model, but the
be-all-end-all is the human interpretability and the usefulness of your
topics.

These models will take a while. So we can skip down to the next cell and
just load the models back up from disk.

We also need to do a
\emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf\%E2\%80\%93idf}{term
frequency-inverse document frequency}} transform on the corpus. This is
a weighting scheme that converts the raw word counts into values that
\emph{decrease} the weight of a word based on how many documents it
appears in (more documents --\textgreater{} proves less informatio about
any individual document, so decrease the weight), and \emph{increases}
it based on how often it appears \emph{within the current document}
(more occurrences --\textgreater{} more important to the document).

    Let's look at some of the LDA outputs and see if we can interpret them.
We'll look at only the top ten highest-likelihood topics, sorted by
decreasing likelihood. Since we did no tweaking of the model parameters
(most notably, the number of topics), we shouldn't expect to see very
coherent topics. Of course, tweaking these parameters is largely a
guessing game, involving tweaks followed by manually inspecting the
results. This is beyond the scope of this talk, so for now it's enough
to show how a basic LDA model is run in Gensim.

\subsection{Word Embeddings}\label{word-embeddings}}

Word embeddings have absolutely taken over the entire field of NLP,
starting with Mikolov et al's 2013 paper on
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781}{Word2Vec}. The basic idea of
these embeddings: * Some notion of ``meaning'' is recoverable from the
\emph{contexts} that a word occurs in * It is possible to generate a
\emph{vector} representation of a word such that \emph{words appearing
in similar contexts have similar vectors} (or, more intuitively, ``are
close to each other'').

Word vectors are used for almost every kind of task: document scoring
and classification, sentiment analysis, document and word clustering,
machine translation (though less commmonly), and more. Plus, they've
been demonstrated to excel at a number of lexical similarity and analogy
tasks.

Gensim has an impelementation of Word2Vec that we can use on our corpus.
spaCy, meanwhile, comes pre-bundled with word vectors computed using
Stanford's GloVe algorithm (which works differently under the hood, but
in terms of how well the vectors actually perform in any application, is
basically identical).

\hypertarget{brief-aside-poincare-embeddings}{%
\subsubsection{Brief aside: Poincare
Embeddings}\label{brief-aside-poincare-embeddings}}

In May 2017, Maximilian Nickel and Douwe Kiela published
\href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08039}{an extremely exciting paper} on
embeddings performed in \emph{hyperbolic space} rather than
\emph{Euclidean space} (all prior models were in Euclidean space). These
embeddings--while not yet well-suited to extracting word similarities
and meanings from large bodies of unlabeled text--show an extreme
aptitude for embedding \emph{graph}- and \emph{network}-like data,
e.g.~WordNet, and can capture various relations like hypernymy/hyponymy
and synonymy quite well. Keep an eye on ``Poincare Embeddings''--lots of
interesting things are sure to happen there soon.

\hypertarget{spacy-word-vectors}{%
\subsubsection{spaCy word vectors}\label{spacy-word-vectors}}

We'll work with spaCy's pre-trained vectors just for time's
sake--training word2vec models in Gensim is surprisingly fast, but we'll
be doing basically the same thing downstream. First, as always, we need
to load our data and our model. We'll just use a single blog post, and
we'll turn off a bunch of the spaCy parsing stuff for speed.

    Word vectors can also be extended to computer vectors for entire
documents. Usually, this is done by simply adding or averaging the
vectors for each individual word in the document. (Incidentally, this
exact same approach lets you get a vector for any arbitrary bit of
text!)

\subsection{Classification and Regression with
Text}\label{classification-and-regression-with-text}}

Since we have vectors representing documents (we can also use the
bag-of-words representation for this, too!), we can do any classical
statistical test or modelling we want, like trying to build a model to
predict the age of a post's author from its contents, or predicting
their gender. But we won't use statistics, because we have tools better
suited to the specifics of the tasks at hand: machine learning.

Without getting too deep in the weeds, machine learning models are
essentially extensions of statistics that are based on
\emph{computational mathematics} rather than \emph{classical
mathematics}. They tend to scale better to massive datasets (i.e.~run
faster and predict better) and are often more powerful for pure
prediction, but they are designed for larger datasets and may not work
well at lower sizes.

However, ultimately, the distinction between ``machine learning'' and
``statistics'' is a false one. The real difference is
``experimentalists'' (who seek to understand \emph{causation}) and
``data miners,'' who only want to build models with good
\emph{predictive power}. (I won't get any further into this--but Leo
Breiman's 2001 paper
\href{https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726}{Statistical
Modeling: The Two Cultures} is an interesting exploration of this
divide).

Python has some absoltuely top-tier machine learning libraries:
Scikit-Learn for non-neural models (e.g.~decision trees, random forests,
support vector machines), and various environments like Keras,
Tensorflow, and Pytorch for building neural networks. We'll use
non-neural models for this demo--they both run faster (as in, by a
factor of days, sometimes) and are \emph{much} easier to interpret.

We'll build six models, using two different sets of target variables and
three different sets of predictors.

Targets: * Author age (regression) * Author gender (binary
classification) * Author's astrological sign (multi-class
classification)

Predictors: * Document vectors, generated by the Doc2Vec algorithm,
which we will train ourselves. * Bag-of-Words model, \emph{without}
tf-idf weighting (it ends up being only marginally helpful for the model
performance of SVMs, but detrimental to the model interpretability)

We'll just one type of model--Support Vector Machines--for both
regression and classification. SVMs strike a nice balance between speed
(though there are faster models) and performance (though there are more
powerful models), and are always a good go-to. For binary classification
tasks, they're still among the best models around. Specifically, we'll
use SVMs with a \emph{linear kernel}--don't worry for now about the
impelementation details of that, just know that a linear kernel SVM runs
faster than other kinds of SVM, and is often plenty good for most tasks.

    Fortunately, all of our categorical data is pretty well-balanged (i.e.,
there isn't too huge of a discrepancy between the number of observations
in each class). For classification tasks this is extremely important,
sometimes moreso than regression tasks.

Now, we \emph{could} get the GloVe vectors from spaCy, but this will
take a pretty long time (about 5 hours on my computer, by my
estimation). So we won't do that. But if we wanted to, the code would
look like this:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

    This might not be the most practical way to get vectors for large
amounts of text due to runtime, but the vectors you get are pretty much
guaranteed to be high-quality (assuming, of course, you're working on
data that's more or less general English, rather than being highly
domain-specific, e.g.~financial filings or court decisions). For
comparison (both of code and of downstream results), we'll also use
Doc2Vec, as implemented in Gensim, to generate our own word vectors.
Doc2Vec is one of the many vectorization/embedding approaches, but
rather than working at the word level, it works directly at the document
level. We'll use a less aggressive preprocessing, since vectorization
models are less sensitive to sparsity; this one just de-accents,
lowercases, and removes tokens by length. We'll leave all settings at
default (so, mininum length 2, maximum length 15).

We'll also use 300-dimensional vectors for our embeddings, which is a
pretty standard size for production code. Note that in general, higher
dimensional embeddings (e.g.~300 vs 100) will give better, more accurate
results, but will be sparser and take longer to run models on.

Note that we're not applying most of the usual preprocessing steps we've
already seen. We're just casting to lowercase and splitting at word
boundaries with a regular expression. We won't even bother with
phrase-finding for this. We're doing this because vectorization
algorithms--especially those based on Word2Vec, including
Doc2Vec--aren't as senstivie to sparsity as Bag of Words models, and
since different inflectional forms of a word might actually occur in
consistently different contexts that we wish to capture.

    We'll create an EpochLogger class from Gensim's CallbackAny2Vec class.
The only thing this will do for us is that, when we pass it to our
Doc2Vec model, it will print out the progress during training. This
doesn't affect the code, but like the tqdm() calls scattered throughout
this notebook, it just lets us keep track of progress.

    And now we re-generate our bag-of-words representation for the by-author
corpus and save it to disk. Note that we could do tf-idf scaling here,
and it might help out results a bit, and it would probably help our
performance a bit, but we won't--it will make interpreting our model
considerably more difficult. Instead, we'll just apply a standard
scaling on the sparse matrix, scaling every feature such that the
maximum absolute value is 1. (we won't center it to zero mean and unit
variance--that would destroy the sparsity and we couldn't load the
matrix into memory)

    Now let's do the actual modeling. We'll use Support Vector Machines for
classification and regression; these are pretty powerful models and
generally pretty good choices. Others, which we won't use here because
they take longer to run, include Random Forests, Adaboost, Stochastic
Gradient Descent (which is fast, but has a \emph{lot} of parameters to
tune), and neural networks.

We will:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use a grid search to exhaustively search for good parameters (within a
  pre-defined search space). This is called \emph{(hyper)parameter
  optimization.}
\item
  Use 3-fold cross-validation to assess model performance for each
  parameter combination we try.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Data is split into 3 equally sized ``folds.'' (usually, 5 or 10
    folds would be used, but for time's sake, 3 will suffice here).
  \item
    Four folds are used to train the model; the fifth is used to assess
    its performance.
  \item
    All permutations of ``train-on-2, test-on-1'' are performed, and
    scores are averaged to get the overall model performance.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Print out the best model parameters and the best score for each of our
  nine feature-target combinations.
\item
  ``Open up'' one of the models and look at the feature weights it
  learned.
\end{itemize}

Cross-fold validation is often used in place of statistical significance
testing in the machine learning world. There are a lot of reasons for
this, and the differences are pretty interesting, but for our purposes,
we only need to know two things to understand why we prefer
cross-validation to significance testing. 1. In most practical cases, ML
models are being used with an eye towards strong \emph{predictive power}
rather than strong \emph{explanatory power.} Thus, we're more interested
in assessing how well our model generalizes to new data rather than the
statistical significance of relationships we uncover. 2. Cross-fold
validation evaluates the model on data that it did not see during
training, approximating the process of feeding novel data into the
model. This is far more reliable on very large, randomly sampled
datasets.

calculating the F1 scores from treating these permutations as our
predictions.
